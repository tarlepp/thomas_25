# What is this?

Just a quick demo how to use Docker

## Question

Someone asked help on ##php

```
19:22 < thomas_25> Is there LAMP-like bundle for Mac OS that I can select the version of each element? (i.e. I want PHP 5.6, and
                   MariaDB 10)
```

So this repository contains simple example how to make that happen with docker.

## Usage

Just clone this repository, install docker and docker-compose and after that run
following command;

```bash
docker-compose up
```

After that just open your browser `http://localhost:8080`
